The growing accumulation of space debris presents a serious risk to satellites and future space missions. The challenge is to design an autonomous robot that can efficiently navigate space, detect, and collect debris while minimizing fuel consumption and avoiding obstacles like asteroid fields, satellite interference, and unpredictable debris motion. This can be achieved using AI-driven approaches, including search algorithms and optimization techniques.
This helps us to find the optimal path use AI Search algorithms and Clear the Debris
